	<h1>Background Info:</h1>
		<p>Hi, I'm Bryce, and welcome to my profile! I'm a 25-year-old student who is new to RMIT's Bachelor of Information Technology.

		A lifelong passion for all things technology has led me to pursue it as a future career; through my studies I hope to expand and fortify my existing skills and knowledge.

	When I'm not tinkering with hardware, I'm usually found in my home-built recording studio, making all manner of music and learning the ins and outs of audio engineering.</p>

	<h1>Interest in I.T.</h1>
		<p>My interest in I.T. was formed at an early age, initially from scavenging old broken PCs from the junk yard to take home and frankenstein into one functional PC. Fast forward fifteen or so years, and I am currently working for a specialised PC company, assembling high-end custom computers for a variety of applications. From budget gaming rigs, to custom watercooled behemoths, I build them all!

			Recently, I have felt motivated to expand my knowledge beyond the hardware side of things, having always had a keen curiosity for programming, as well as networking fundamentals.

		I'm hoping that through this course, I can gain a well-rounded set of skills that I can utilise in many different I.T. scenarios.

		<h1>Ideal Job:</h1>
		<img src="idealjob.png" alt="Ideal Job" />
		<p>Cyber security has always been an extremely interesting field to me - with the exponential growth of technology we're currently seeing comes equal risk. As fast as new technologies can be developed, so can techniques to exploit these new technologies.

			Analyst positions such as the one depicted above, appeal to me greatly as they offer a chance to combine multiple I.T. disciplines towards the purpose of preventing the exploitation of such technologies, and ultimately the protection of users' confidential data. There is also a sense of competition to be found in this field - a race between hacker and analyst - that I find conceptually motivating.

			Many skills and qualifications are required for this position, as well as a systematic and analytical mindset. Specific skills such as
				<ul>
					<li>Detailed knowledge of networking protocols</li>
					<li>Cisco networking</li>
					<li>CompTIA certifications</li>
				</ul>
