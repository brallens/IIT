	<h1 class="center">My Project Idea</h1>

	<h1 class="center">**MY IDEA IS ESSENTIALLY JUST A THIN CLIENT SO DISREGARD THE FOLLOWING:**</h1>

<p>An intersting project idea, with many real-world applications, is a 100% VPS (Virtual Private Server) hosted device. A device similar to a smartphone, tablet, or even laptop, that functions only as a controller for a VPS hosted elsewhere. Allowing for the user to access their system from a variety of inexpensive "controllers" has many useful applications, as well as many potential obstacles to overcome for it to be a practical solution.

	There are many problems encountered on a daily basis that are the direct result of having our applications and data running on local hardware. We've all been in the position at some point of losing (or breaking! a phone, laptop, tablet, or some other personal device, thus losing precious photos, crucial documents and other important data stored on said device. We've all watched as hard drives and storage devices have gotten increasingly compact, while offering larger volumes of storage than ever. But what if we could remove the need for local processing and storage all together?

	There are already existing solutions to some of these problems, cloud storage immediately coming to mind. However, an extremely interesting concept is that of a range of products requiring little to no on-board processing or storage. Think, how much cheaper, how much smaller, could our laptops and smartphones be if they required no hard drive, no processor? How reassuring would it be to know that your entire system would remain untouched even if your laptop suffered a tragic accident? These reasons alone provide ample motivation to undertake such a project.

	The goal of the project would be to create a product, or line of products, with only enough processing power to act as a "controller" of a system hosted on a powerful server at a remote location. Ideally, there would be many servers, with each server hosting many virtual machines, each virtual machine having a certain amount of processing power and storage allocated to it based on the user's needs and price point. The device itself would resemble a laptop (or a smartphone or tablet), but would contain a microprocessor with only enough power to run a very basic piece of software to establish and facilitate the connection to the VPS. With all storage and processing being handled by the remote server, this would make for a very lightweight and inexpensive product, with very long battery life.

	Required for this project, would firstly be a powerful, reliable server, with an extremely fast internet connection, un-interruptable power supply, at a secure, temperature-regulated physical location. For a large-scale implementation of this project, an entire server farm would be required, increasing the requirements for physical space, adequate cooling, adequate power supply and failsafes.
	Lightweight software would need to be developed to run on both the device and the server to create a network tunnel between the two devices.
	Security protocols will need to be implemented to ensure the security and integrity of the data and the networks.

	A broad range of skills will be required for the successful implementation of this project. A strong understanding of network protocols will be necessary to establish secure network tunnels between controller and server. Strong programming fundamentals will be required in order to develop the firmware to be run on the controllers, as well as to develop any server-side software required to facilitate stable connection.
	Other non-technical skills will be required for this project as well. A broad range of protocols will need to be established for personnel working on-site to ensure the security of the servers and local storage. Extensive planning will be required to establish failsafes and redundancies to prevent data loss and power failures. Advanced cooling solutions will be required to keep systems running at optimal temperatures.

	There will be a variety of obstacles and limitations faced throughout this project. Technical obstacles will include:
		<li>Latency will be the primary limitation of this project. An extremely fast connection will be required between the user and the host for this concept to be a practical solution</li>
		<li>Data transfer via a network over long distances will never be as fast as locally stored data. Writing to a local HDD/SSD will always be faster </li>
		<li>Security. As with anything remotely accessible, there is greater opportunity for compromise.</li>
		<li>Cost. The extreme hosting requirements of such a project will be expensive to do properly.</li>
		<li>Such complex server configuration will be difficult.</li>
		<li>Customisation. The user will lack the ability to tailor the hardware to better suit their needs like they would be able to with a physical machine.</li>

	However, if these difficulties can be overcome, the user will benefit from
		<li>Cheaper and smaller devices</li>
		<li>Greater accessibility to their data</li>
		<li>Protection from loss of data due to device loss/damage</li>
		<li>Increased battery life </li>
