		<p class="center">Despite being somewhat contradictory, there are a number of interesting things these results reveal:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>As an Introvert, I will need to endeavour to voice my opinions when working as part of a team</li>
					<li>As a "Logician", I have many traits that could be considered complementary to a career in I.T. My ability to objectively approach a problem and arrive at an unbiased solution will set me in good stead in both singular and group projects</li>
					<li>As someone who is NOT particularly conscientious by nature, I will need to take steps to ensure that I present an organised approach within a team</li>
				</ul>
